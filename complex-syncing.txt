The scenario is:

    multiple people working on a repo in separate branched.
    1 person has merged to remote master a single updated file.
    The other person needs to get that update to their working local branch.


The flow is:

    The person needed the updated master file
        add, commit and push their local branch to remote branch. So that there local and remote branch have no deltas.
        then switch to local branch to master
        then fetch and ensure the local master has no deltas with remote master
        switch back to working local branch
        checkout the file from master to local


# add, commit and push their local branch to remote branch. So that there local and remote branch have no deltas.
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<your message>"
$ git push origin <your branch>

# then switch to local branch to master
$ git checkout master

# then fetch and ensure the local master has no deltas with remote master
$ git fetch
$ git reset --hard origin/master

# switch back to working local branch
$ git checkout <your branch>

# checkout the file from master to local
$ git checkout master <file name - add directory if needed>
